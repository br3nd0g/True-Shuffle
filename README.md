# True-Spotify-Shuffle

An application that allows users to shuffle one of their playlists without spotify's bias, using the spotify API. Find it [here](https://true-spotify-shuffle.brendawg.repl.co/).

As an avid user of spotify I have noticed that when shuffling a playlist it shuffles it with a bias from the algorithm, tending to play songs that it determines the user likes more first. This isn't true shuffling. This inspired the idea of True Spotify Shuffle, which truly shuffles a user's playlist.

It uses that Spotify API to get the user's playlists, and once one is submitted it retrieves its tracks, shuffling the URIs in an array, then creating a new playlist and adding the shuffled tracks to it.

The user can then listen to this playlist with shuffle mode of (although it will then be shuffled, without a bias)

## What I Learnt

I managed to deepen my understanding of using HTTP requests, which I had used before but not to the extent I had this time. 

I also learnt how to use the spotify API, helping me learn to work with a third party, but I don't think I will be using it again, as I don't really have any projects I think i will do with Spotify integration.
